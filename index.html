<hr WIDTH="100%">Welcome! On this website, you can find links to my electronics
projects. If you want to make any of these yourself, you can have the PCBs
manufactured by a fabricator such as <a href="https://jlcpcb.com">JLCPCB</a>,
<a href="https://www.elecrow.com">Elecrow</a>
or <a href="https://www.pcbway.com">PCBWay</a>. Components can be purchased
at <a href="https://www.mouser.com">Mouser</a> or <a href="https://www.digikey.com">Digikey</a>;
both companies ship worldwide.
<p>If you have any questions relating to a circuit or you'd like to suggest
modifications/improvements, you can reach me at my email address:
