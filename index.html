<hr WIDTH="100%">Welcome! On this website, you can find links to my electronics
projects. If you want to make any of these yourself, you can have the PCBs
manufactured by a fabricator such as <a href="https://jlcpcb.com">JLCPCB</a>,
<a href="https://www.elecrow.com">Elecrow</a>
or <a href="https://www.pcbway.com">PCBWay</a>. Most components can be
purchased at <a href="https://www.mouser.com">Mouser</a> or <a href="https://www.digikey.com">Digikey</a>;
both companies ship worldwide.
<p>If you have any questions relating to a circuit or you'd like to suggest
modifications/improvements, you can reach me at my email address:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>al5338 { letter "a" with a circle around it }
seznam { full stop/period/point } cz</i>
<br>I check my inbox approximately once per week.
<p>All my creations are open source; you are free to distribute, modify
and sell them however you like.

A Soviet-Designed ZX Spectrum Clone</a></font></i></h2>
A 48K Sinclair ZX Spectrum clone from 1988 that can still be built today
using readily available components. Designed to be as simple as possible
hardware-wise, requiring as few as 44 ICs (compared to around 60 ICs on
most clones).
