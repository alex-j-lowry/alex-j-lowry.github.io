Much of thisearly cloning work happened in countries where the original Spectrum washard to find, usually due to international trade restrictions.<p>The most notable example of this was the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc.While affordable homemade computers already existed in this part of theworld, there was rarely any financial incentive to write video games duringcommunist times, so there was an incentive to design a computer that couldrun the hundreds <i>(if not thousands)</i> of Spectrum games that had beenwritten in the West.<p>Due to Soviet-era supply chain issues, such a computer would need tobe designed using the most commonly available parts possible, while stillbeing affordable on the humble average salary of the USSR.<p>Many Spectrum-compatible computers were designed in the USSR, but themost popular one was the "Leningrad variant", designed by Sergey Zonovin 1988. This design found its way into dozens of mass-produced computersaround the USSR, and remained on the market well into the 1990's.<p>With retro computing becoming a more mainstream hobby, the price oforiginal Sinclair hardware has increased to the point that building yourown Spectrum costs about as much as buying an original one.<p>The Leningrad-M is my second replica of the Leningrad computer. I'vereplaced all the rare ICs with more common ones, fixed hardware bugs, reducedthe size of the PCBs and lowered the component count. The result is a computerthat can be built with <b><i>38 ICs,</i></b> a remarkably low amount fora ZX Spectrum clone that doesn't use a programmable logic array.<h4><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Technical Description</font></i></h4><a href="photos/lgdm4_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgdm4_th.jpg" ALT="Leningrad-M system PCB" NOSAVE height=213 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>Whilethe Leningrad-M is not 100% compatible with the original ZX Spectrum, I'vefound that it works with a remarkably wide range of software, includingdemos that rely on obscure programming tricks. Having tested my Leningrad-Mwith a decent amount of programs, I'd say 97-98% work with no problemswhatsoever.<p>The composite video output is monochrome. A DE-9 connector on the upperright of the PCB can be used to connect color video adapters, such as the<a href="nimf-4.html">NIMF-4,</a> which outputs composite video with PAL encoding.<p>It should be noted that if you live in a country where NTSC is the standard,you may have problems getting your monitor to sync to the 50Hz signal thiscomputer generates. It may be possible to correct this by using a fastercrystal oscillator and adjusting the "border width" jumpers on the PCB,but I haven't tested this.<p>I have made an effort to make this computer as easy to build as possible.The value of almost every component <i>(excluding pin headers and two connectors)</i>is printed on the silkscreen, so it's possible to assemble the whole thingwithout having to check the bill of materials.<p>To aid in ease of construction <i>(and cost reduction)</i>, the topand bottom of the static-sensitive system PCB can be protected withouthaving to fabricate a case. The keyboard PCB is designed to mount on topof the system PCB with standard nylon M3 screws and standoffs. Since mostPCB fabricators require that you order a minimum of 5 boards per design,you can use one of the spare keyboard PCBs to cover the bottom side ofthe system PCB.<p>The keyboard and system PCBs are mounted together with 7 M3 nylon standoffs.The keyboard has an extra hole for a standoff that goes through the keyboardand sits on top of the system PCB. These are intended to add structuralstability - perfect for fast-paced action games!<h4><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Making the Keyboard</font></i></h4><a href="photos/lgrd4_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgrd4_th.jpg" ALT="Keyboard labels" NOSAVE height=213 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>TheZX Spectrum was designed long before keyboard layouts had been standardized.In addition, each key corresponds to several BASIC commands, which areprinted on the keys. Unfortunately, nobody makes Cherry MX compatible keycapswith ZX Spectrum commands printed on them, so you have to make your own.<p>I've found that the best way to do this is to order keycaps with removabletransparent covers (the same type often seen on point-of-sale terminals)and print out labels to cut out and insert in the keycaps. Such keycapscan be ordered cheaply from eBay or AliExpress under the search term "transparentcover key caps".<p>The end result is professional-looking <i>(depending on how good yourcutting skills are)</i>, durable keycaps that won't wear out over time.<p>A pre-made image of key labels can be downloaded further down the page.I designed it based on a combination of <a href="photos/lgrd6_fs.jpg">theoriginal Spectrum keyboard</a> and the labels from <a href="photos/lgrd5_fs.jpg">thisSoviet DIY computer kit</a> <i>(which was based on the Leningrad-1).</i><p>In total, the keyboard PCB has 40 single width keys in the originalZX Spectrum layout, and one 6.25x width spacebar. To build the keyboard,you'll need:<ul><li>5-pin MX-compatible keyswitches <b>(x41)</b> - <i>3-pin switches will workas well, but they're trickier to mount evenly on the PCB.</i></li><li>1x width transparent cover key caps <b>(x40)</b></li><li>6.25x width spacebar <b>(x1)</b></li><li>6.25x width MX-compatible spacebar stabilizer <b>(x1)</b> - <i>There appearto be two versions of this, a panel mounted version and a PCB mounted version.Only the PCB mounted version will fit on the PCB.</i></li></ul>Technically the spacebar is optional, since the keyboard retains the cornerspace key as seen on the original Spectrum.<h4><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Burning the ROM</font></i></h4><a href="photos/eprm1_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/eprm1_th.jpg" ALT="27128 EPROM" NOSAVE height=198 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>Ifyou don't already have an (E)EPROM programmer, getting Sinclair BASIC ontoa ROM may be difficult.<p>By default, the Leningrad-M uses the original Sinclair ROM data burntonto a 27128 EPROM. It's possible to use some other models of (E)EPROM,usually if the binary is written to the upper 16 KB of the chip.<p>Some eBay sellers here in the UK sell pre-programmed EPROMs with newer,open source versions of BASIC on them. These usually come with extra componentsfor modifying an original Spectrum to work with EPROMs, but these aren'tneeded for Spectrum clones.<p><a href="eprom.html">I have written an in-depth guide on how to getstarted programming ROMs on this page,</a> with recommendations for whatkind of programmer to buy and a list of other chips that can be used inplace of the 27128.<p>The (E)EPROM programming guide also has a collection of alternativeBASIC ROMs available for download.<h4><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Schematic</font></i></h4>One thing that drew me towards recreating this ZX Spectrum clone in particularis that the schematic is relatively easy to understand, despite its complexity.I've annotated the schematic to the best of my ability to help explainhow the Leningrad-M works at the lowest level.<p>The schematic can be downloaded in PDF form in the Downloads sectionof this page.<h4><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Getting Software</font></i></h4><a href="photos/lgdm6_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgdm6_th.jpg" ALT="Complete setup" NOSAVE height=208 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>TheLeningrad-M's tape interface is compatible with original ZX Spectrum tapes,with the exception that I haven't been able to get fast loading tapes towork. This usually isn't a problem, since many programs were re-releasedmultiple times, and there's normally at least one version without fastloading.<p>Most Spectrum programs are distributed online as TAP or TZX files -these are binary versions of the stream of data from the tape. These filesare designed for use primarily with emulators, and loading them onto realhardware can be difficult.<p>There's a variety of programs available that can convert these filesinto more versatile standard audio formats. My favorite one is k7zx forWindows, which you can download further down the page. It's a program from2008, so it should run on Windows versions going back to XP <i>(maybe 2000)</i>,and it runs well on my Windows 10 machine.<h4><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Changelog</font></i></h4><i>Revision 0:</i><br>My Leningrad-1 replica, as seen <a href="leningrd.html">here.</a><p><i>Revision 1:</i><br>The first Leningrad-M, as seen in the photos.<ul><li>64kbit x 1 RAM ICs replaced with 64kbit x 4 ICs.
