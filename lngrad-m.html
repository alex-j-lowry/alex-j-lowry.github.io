<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/lgdm1_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgdm1_th.jpg" ALT="Leningrad-M in operation" NOSAVE height=220 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>Sinclair's
ZX Spectrum is one of the most widely cloned computers ever made.As early
as the mid 1980's, people were reverse-engineering the ULA, the custom
IC that provided the Spectrum with much of its functionality. Much of this
early cloning work happened in countries where the original Spectrum was
hard to find, usually due to international trade restrictions.
<p>The most notable example of this was the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc.
While affordable homemade computers already existed in this part of the
world, there was rarely any financial incentive to write video games during
communist times, so there was an incentive to design a computer that could
run the hundreds <i>(if not thousands)</i> of Spectrum games that had been
written in the West.
<p>Due to Soviet-era supply chain issues, such a computer would need to
be designed using the most commonly available parts possible, while still
being affordable on the humble average salary of the USSR.
<p>Many Spectrum-compatible computers were designed in the USSR, but the
most popular one was the "Leningrad variant", designed by Sergey Zonov
in 1988. This design found its way into dozens of mass-produced computers
around the USSR, and remained on the market well into the 1990's.
<p>With retro computing becoming a more mainstream hobby, the price of
original Sinclair hardware has increased to the point that building your
own Spectrum costs about as much as buying an original one.
<p>The Leningrad-M is my second replica of the Leningrad computer. I've
replaced all the rare ICs with more common ones, fixed hardware bugs, reduced
the size of the PCBs and lowered the component count. The result is a computer
that can be built with <b><i>38 ICs,</i></b> a remarkably low amount for
a ZX Spectrum clone that doesn't use a programmable logic array.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Technical Description</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/lgdm4_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgdm4_th.jpg" ALT="Leningrad-M system PCB" NOSAVE height=213 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>While
the Leningrad-M is not 100% compatible with the original ZX Spectrum, I've
found that it works with a remarkably wide range of software, including
demos that rely on obscure programming tricks. Having tested my Leningrad-M
with a decent amount of programs, I'd say 97-98% work with no problems
whatsoever.
<p>The composite video output is monochrome. A DE-9 connector on the upper
right of the PCB can be used to connect color video adapters, such as the
<a href="nimf-4.html">NIMF-4,</a> which outputs composite video with PAL encoding.
<p>It should be noted that if you live in a country where NTSC is the standard,
you may have problems getting your monitor to sync to the 50Hz signal this
computer generates. It may be possible to correct this by using a faster
crystal oscillator and adjusting the "border width" jumpers on the PCB,
but I haven't tested this.
<p>I have made an effort to make this computer as easy to build as possible.
The value of almost every component <i>(excluding pin headers and two connectors)</i>
is printed on the silkscreen, so it's possible to assemble the whole thing
without having to check the bill of materials.
<p>To aid in ease of construction <i>(and cost reduction)</i>, the top
and bottom of the static-sensitive system PCB can be protected without
having to fabricate a case. The keyboard PCB is designed to mount on top
of the system PCB with standard nylon M3 screws and standoffs. Since most
PCB fabricators require that you order a minimum of 5 boards per design,
you can use one of the spare keyboard PCBs to cover the bottom side of
the system PCB.
<p>The keyboard and system PCBs are mounted together with 7 M3 nylon standoffs.
The keyboard has an extra hole for a standoff that goes through the keyboard
and sits on top of the system PCB. These are intended to add structural
stability - perfect for fast-paced action games!
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Making the Keyboard</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/lgrd4_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgrd4_th.jpg" ALT="Keyboard labels" NOSAVE height=213 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>The
ZX Spectrum was designed long before keyboard layouts had been standardized.
In addition, each key corresponds to several BASIC commands, which are
printed on the keys. Unfortunately, nobody makes Cherry MX compatible keycaps
with ZX Spectrum commands printed on them, so you have to make your own.
<p>I've found that the best way to do this is to order keycaps with removable
transparent covers (the same type often seen on point-of-sale terminals)
and print out labels to cut out and insert in the keycaps. Such keycaps
can be ordered cheaply from eBay or AliExpress under the search term "transparent
cover key caps".
<p>The end result is professional-looking <i>(depending on how good your
cutting skills are)</i>, durable keycaps that won't wear out over time.
<p>A pre-made image of key labels can be downloaded further down the page.
I designed it based on a combination of <a href="photos/lgrd6_fs.jpg">the
original Spectrum keyboard</a> and the labels from <a href="photos/lgrd5_fs.jpg">this
Soviet DIY computer kit</a> <i>(which was based on the Leningrad-1).</i>
<p>In total, the keyboard PCB has 40 single width keys in the original
ZX Spectrum layout, and one 6.25x width spacebar. To build the keyboard,
you'll need:
<ul>
<li>
5-pin MX-compatible keyswitches <b>(x41)</b> - <i>3-pin switches will work
as well, but they're trickier to mount evenly on the PCB.</i></li>

<li>
1x width transparent cover key caps <b>(x40)</b></li>

<li>
6.25x width spacebar <b>(x1)</b></li>

<li>
6.25x width MX-compatible spacebar stabilizer <b>(x1)</b> - <i>There appear
to be two versions of this, a panel mounted version and a PCB mounted version.
Only the PCB mounted version will fit on the PCB.</i></li>
</ul>
Technically the spacebar is optional, since the keyboard retains the corner
space key as seen on the original Spectrum.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Burning the ROM</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/eprm1_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/eprm1_th.jpg" ALT="27128 EPROM" NOSAVE height=198 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>If
you don't already have an (E)EPROM programmer, getting Sinclair BASIC onto
a ROM may be difficult.
<p>By default, the Leningrad-M uses the original Sinclair ROM data burnt
onto a 27128 EPROM. It's possible to use some other models of (E)EPROM,
usually if the binary is written to the upper 16 KB of the chip.
<p>Some eBay sellers here in the UK sell pre-programmed EPROMs with newer,
open source versions of BASIC on them. These usually come with extra components
for modifying an original Spectrum to work with EPROMs, but these aren't
needed for Spectrum clones.
<p><a href="eprom.html">I have written an in-depth guide on how to get
started programming ROMs on this page,</a> with recommendations for what
kind of programmer to buy and a list of other chips that can be used in
place of the 27128.
<p>The (E)EPROM programming guide also has a collection of alternative
BASIC ROMs available for download.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Schematic</font></i></h4>
One thing that drew me towards recreating this ZX Spectrum clone in particular
is that the schematic is relatively easy to understand, despite its complexity.
I've annotated the schematic to the best of my ability to help explain
how the Leningrad-M works at the lowest level.
<p>The schematic can be downloaded in PDF form in the Downloads section
of this page.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Getting Software</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/lgdm6_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgdm6_th.jpg" ALT="Complete setup" NOSAVE height=208 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>The
Leningrad-M's tape interface is compatible with original ZX Spectrum tapes,
with the exception that I haven't been able to get fast loading tapes to
work. This usually isn't a problem, since many programs were re-released
multiple times, and there's normally at least one version without fast
loading.
<p>Most Spectrum programs are distributed online as TAP or TZX files -
these are binary versions of the stream of data from the tape. These files
are designed for use primarily with emulators, and loading them onto real
hardware can be difficult.
<p>There's a variety of programs available that can convert these files
into more versatile standard audio formats. My favorite one is k7zx for
Windows, which you can download further down the page. It's a program from
2008, so it should run on Windows versions going back to XP <i>(maybe 2000)</i>,
and it runs well on my Windows 10 machine.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Changelog</font></i></h4>
<i>Revision 0:</i>
<br>My Leningrad-1 replica, as seen <a href="leningrd.html">here.</a>
<p><i>Revision 1:</i>
<br>The first Leningrad-M, as seen in the photos.
<ul>
<li>
64kbit x 1 RAM ICs replaced with 64kbit x 4 ICs. Only 2 of these are required,
as opposed to 8.</li>

<li>
Tape loading circuit replaced with a simpler circuit from Leningrad-2.</li>

<li>
Sinclair joystick interface implemented on keyboard PCB.</li>

<li>
RGB/audio connector changed to DE-9, allowing adapters (such as <a href="nimf-4.html">this
one</a>) to be connected directly without cables.</li>

<li>
SCART connector removed. I plan to design a SCART adapter in the future.</li>

<li>
I/O devices are now only enabled when A0 and A5 are low, preventing Yamaha
AY commands from conflicting with the I/O circuitry.</li>
</ul>
<i>Revision 2:</i>
<br>A minor bugfix to improve the duration of the black level pulse. I've
tested this fix on my Rev. 1 system with a jumper wire. This is the version
available for download further down the page.
