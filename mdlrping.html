<a href="photos/ping1_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/ping1_th.jpg" ALT="Modular Ping in operation" NOSAVE height=320 width=317 align=RIGHT></a>Dating
all the way back to 1972, Atari's Pong was the first video game popular
enough to become a household name <i>(though contrary to popular belief,
it certainly wasn't the first video game ever produced!).</i>
<p>Atari co-founders Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney had already developed
a video arcade game the previous year, known as Computer Space. Despite
being more technically advanced than Pong, it didn't achieve the success
they were hoping for - the rules of the game weren't obvious, and players
had to read the instructions to understand how to play.
<p>They quickly realized that arcade-goers preferred more intuitive video
games that were easy to pick up and play. In May 1972, Nolan visited a
demonstration of the soon-to-be-released Magnavox Odyssey, an early consumer-grade
home game console based largely on analog circuitry. There, he realized
that its simple "Tennis" game could be improved if it was implemented with
the same digital logic used in Computer Space.
<p>The task of developing Pong was given to new hire Allan Alcorn, who
was instructed to create a digital tennis video game with counters to keep
track of the score.
<p>In the early 70's, microprocessors were expensive and rudimentary. Therefore,
Pong was designed entirely with discrete TTL logic! It's a video game implemented
with no software whatsoever, a concept that sounds unthinkable nowadays.
<p>Upon completing the basic game, Allan added some extra features to make
the game more interesting - the ball would speed up if players could keep
up a volley without missing, and would bounce back at a variable angle
depending on where the paddles hit it.
<p>One of the last features added was sound. Timing signals that were already
in the circuit were fed through a loudspeaker to create the characteristic
sounds that inspired the name "Pong". <i>(or "Ping" in the case of my replica,
since Atari still holds the rights to the name "Pong".)</i>
<p>A few years after the development of Pong, large-scale integration would
allow a simplified version of the game logic to be crammed into a single
custom IC. However, these later home versions of Pong usually simplified
the ball velocity logic in comparison to the original arcade game.
<p>In the years following the development of Pong, many other arcade games
would be implemented entirely out of TTL logic. The introduction of the
Intel 8080 CPU in 1974 gradually brought an end to this era of arcade gaming
in favor of microprocessor-based games, and by 1980, production of TTL
arcade games was a thing of the past.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Technical Description</font></i></h4>
In Modular Ping, the circuitry of Pong has been separated into a "base
system" of five PCBs.
<ol>
<li>
<b>Power, Sync, Video:</b> The 5V power regulator/supply, synchronization
generator, and video output.</li>

<li>
<b>Paddles, Game Control:</b> Determines paddle position and handles game
logic. <i>(Collision detection, game reset, demo mode, etc.)</i></li>

<li>
<b>Score:</b> Keeps track of both players' score in binary-coded decimal
<i>(BCD)</i>
format, which is converted into human-readable numerals by a 7-segment
decoder IC.</li>

<li>
<b>Vertical Ball, Sound:</b> Controls the ball's vertical position, direction
and speed, determining the angle at which the ball should return upon collision
with the bats. Generates sound effects upon collisions and misses.</li>

<li>
<b>Horizontal Ball:</b> Controls the ball's horizontal position, direction
and speed. Increases the ball's horizontal speed if players are able to
maintain a volley without missing the ball for long enough.</li>
</ol>
<a href="photos/ping6_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/ping6_th.jpg" ALT="Close-up of assembled system" NOSAVE height=203 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>The
original Pong circuit contained some minor bugs which aren't normally noticeable
during gameplay. These bugs have been documented in two articles (<a href="https://www.worldphaco.com/uploads/LAWN_TENNIS.pdf">here</a>
and <a href="https://www.worldphaco.com/uploads/ARCADE_MINI-PONG.pdf">here</a>)
by <a href="https://www.worldphaco.com">Dr. Hugo R. Holden,</a> who has
developed modifications to fix the errors without using any extra circuitry.
I've implemented some of these fixes in Modular Ping, though some couldn't
be implemented without increasing the number of components, since unused
logic can only be connected "locally" on its respective PCB.
<p>The following bugs have been corrected in Modular Ping:
<ul>
<li>
<b>The "Ghost in the Machine":</b> The vertical speed of the ball is determined
upon collision with either bat by a 3-bit binary value. In the original
circuit, the least significant bit was accidentally switched between players,
resulting in the ball's rebound angle being partially determined by the
opposite bat.</li>

<li>
<b>Ball trapped in blanking:</b> In extremely rare cases, it's possible
for the ball to become trapped in the vertical blanking interval. In an
unmodified original system, this would only occur rarely upon switching
the machine on. It can only happen during gameplay if the range of the
bats is modified to span the entire screen <i>(a currently unimplemented
bugfix I may add in a later revision).</i></li>

<li>
<b>Weak net:</b> At some point, the 7493 counter ICs used in the sync generator
were phased out in favor of the faster 7493A counter. The slight difference
in propagation speed can affect the width of the net, potentially reducing
it to the point that it's barely visible. By triggering the net flip-flop
with a different signal, the net remains the same width regardless of the
counter variant used.</li>
</ul>
The PCBs connect to each other using two 40-pin IDC ribbon cables. You'll
have to make these cables yourself, since short cables with five connectors
on them are difficult to find prefabricated. 40-pin IDC connectors can
be crimped with an ordinary vise or a specialized IDC crimping tool (available
online for around $15-20).
<p>The pinout of these connectors <i>(which I've named PingBus A and B)</i>
can be found in the schematics, available below in the "Downloads" section.
<p>The boards are designed to stack on top of each other with standard
M3 screws and standoffs. Nylon fixtures can be used, but I recommend using
metal ones to improve grounding between boards.
<p>In total, the base system requires 63 ICs. This is slightly less than
the original Pong circuit, due to the usage of the 74LS393, 74LS390 and
NE556N - dual versions of the 74LS93, 74LS90 and NE555N, respectively.
<p>The number of ICs which are no longer produced has also been reduced
significantly. The only two components that aren't available directly from
Mouser/Digikey are the 74LS48 used for decoding the score and the NE556N
used to generate the delay for each paddle. Due to the layout of the circuit,
different NE556 variants will give different results, potentially causing
incorrect paddle range or non-linear control. For correct operation, look
for an NE556N produced by Signetics.
<p>In the future, I may try designing an alternative paddle circuit that
uses a modern replacement for the NE556N, such as the 74LS221.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Changelog</font></i></h4>
<i>Revision 0:</i>
<br>Initial prototype.
<ul>
<li>
Upon switching the system on, the ball would only move vertically. After
a few minutes of operation, the ball would incomprehensibly start moving
horizontally as it should. I figured out that this could be corrected by
connecting a 220pF capacitor between /H_BLANK and GND. I assume this bug
must be caused by the difference in switching speed of modern 74LSxx logic
compared to the 74xx logic used in the original system.</li>

<li>
I attempted to improve the timing of the /H_SYNC signal using a spare XOR
gate, but this had the unintended effect of reducing the size of the paddles.</li>
</ul>
<i>Revision 1:</i>
<ul>
<li>
220pF capacitor added to /H_BLANK signal, improving reliability of horizontal
ball movement.</li>

<li>
Clock input of U6A flip-flop on sync/video PCB corrected to H_RESET. The
redrawn schematic I was following had it incorrectly labeled as CLK.</li>

<li>
/H_SYNC signal generator reverted to original arcade circuit configuration.</li>

<li>
100μF capacitors added between VCC and GND on each PCB to improve supply
voltage stability. These aren't really necessary, but I figured it's better
to have the option of adding them if desired.</li>
</ul>
