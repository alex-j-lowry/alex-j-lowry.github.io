<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/prbe1_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/prbe1_th.jpg" ALT="Logic probe" NOSAVE height=206 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>When
building or repairing digital electronics, a logic probe is a useful tool.
Not only is it a much cheaper alternative to an oscilloscope, it's smaller,
easier to use and quicker to set up.
<p>In 1983, Voja Antonić designed the Galaksija, a Z80-based computer
people would buy the parts for and build themselves. It was the first affordable
computer of its kind in Yugoslavia, and the first that could be owned without
having to smuggle a Western computer across the border. <i>(At this time,
Western import products exceeding a certain value were not allowed into
the country.)</i>
<p>In <i>Računari u vašoj kući,</i> the magazine where instructions
for building the Galaksija were published, author Dejan Ristanović recommended
that those experiencing difficulty getting their Galaksija to work try
building a logic probe for troubleshooting, providing a schematic for this
purpose.
<p>This design has a lot of functionality considering its low component
count, requiring only two 7400-series ICs, seven resistors and six LEDs.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Technical Description</font></i></h4>
The probe has the usual <i>HIGH</i> and <i>LOW</i> LEDs, but its unique
feature is its four clock LEDs. Driven by a 74LS93 binary counter, each
LED blinks at half the speed of the LED to its left when connected to an
oscillating signal. This helps give a rough indication of clockspeed relative
to other signals on the tested circuit.
<p><i>In theory,</i> this probe should work with signals as fast as ~65MHz,
the maximum speed of 74LS logic. If nothing else limits the probe's speed,
you could raise this maximum to ~90MHz by using 74ALS chips instead. <i>(Again,
this is theoretical - the highest speed I've used it at so far is 14MHz.)</i>
<p>Being a TTL design, this probe will only work with 5V logic signals
<i>(and
a 5V power source!).</i> Since it's a very simple circuit, it may be possible
to substitute the 74LS ICs for 74HC. <i>(HC = Hi-speed CMOS, 2-6V supply
voltage range)</i>
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Assembly Instructions</font></i></h4>
The most difficult part of building a logic probe is getting the 'probe'
itself - the metal needle at the end. Nobody seems to sell solderable needles
of a suitable size for this purpose.
<p>The best method I've found is to buy a set of copper nails <i>(look
for the thinnest nails possible),</i> coating one in solder to prevent
oxidation, cutting off the head of the nail and soldering it onto the large
solder pad at the end of the PCB, as seen in the above photo. I recommend
using a lot of flux on the nail and solder pad. <i>(Remember to clean it
off afterwards!)</i> This is the method I used for the probe seen in the
photo at the top of the page.
<p>Preparing and attaching the nail should be the first thing you do, since
it's the most difficult thing to solder to the PCB.
<p>Like most logic probes, you must connect it to the 5V voltage supply
of the circuit you are testing. A standard barrel jack on the back of the
probe allows for easy replacement of the power cable, as different circuits
are likely to have different kinds of connection points available for connecting
to VCC and GND.
<p>The most versatile connectors to put on the end of the cable are a pair
of female 2.54mm DuPont connectors. These can be connected to pin headers
and IDC ribbon cable connectors.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Version Differences</font></i></h4>
I've designed three versions of this logic probe.
<ul>
<li>
Revision 0 was one of the first PCBs I designed, so it's a little less
refined.</li>

<li>
Revision 1 is more professional looking, alough I haven't tested it yet.</li>

<li>
There's also an SMD version. The components used are fairly large by SMD
standards, so it's a good introduction to SMD soldering. The LEDs and power
connector on this version are still through-hole. This version is slightly
thinner and longer than the through-hole version.</li>
</ul>
