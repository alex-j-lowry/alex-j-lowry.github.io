<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/lgrd2_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgrd2_th.jpg" ALT="Leningrad-1" NOSAVE height=201 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>When
Sinclair released the original ZX Spectrum in 1982, it was designed with
a chip called the ULA, short for 'uncommitted logic array'. This chip combined
a large amount of logic functions into a single custom-made package, significantly
lowering the component count and cost.
<p>In modern times, when it costs about as much to buy an old Spectrum
as it does to build your own, building a Spectrum based on the original
circuit is severely hindered by the fact that these chips were only made
for the Spectrum and different versions were used on each PCB revision,
making them extremely rare today.
<p>The ULA also generates a lot of heat, so due to being installed without
a heatsink and placed into a case with no ventilation <i>(as was done in
the original Spectrum),</i> overheating is a common failure point. As a
result, most new old stock ULAs have already been used to repair existing
machines.
<p>Therefore, it has become something of an art form in electronics to
design a Spectrum clone that only uses parts that are still readily available.
The most well known example of this is probably the <a href="https://github.com/DonSuperfo/Superfo-Harlequin-128">Superfo
Harlequin 128</a>, a 100% compatible Spectrum 128K clone built entirely
with off-the-shelf parts. The only downside of this design is its high
chip count. <b>(61 ICs)</b>
<p>The art of cloning the ZX Spectrum is not a modern concept, however
- in fact, it's almost as old as the Spectrum itself! Countries where original
Sinclair hardware was difficult to obtain <i>(due to economic tariffs,
sanctions, etc.)</i> often had very lenient copyright laws, allowing the
existence of domestic industries dedicated to replicating the Spectrum's
hardware with the parts available to them. This resulted in computers with
a large software base immediately upon release, since only one copy of
a program needed to be smuggled into the country for it to be copied and
distributed en masse.
<p>The most notable example of this is probably the Soviet Union and surrounding
Eastern Bloc. Development of clones in this part of the world began around
1985, with early models consisting of around <b>50-60 ICs</b>. However,
the complexity of these early homemade clones made them expensive and difficult
to build and troubleshoot, so they weren't very popular.
<p>In 1988, an electronics engineer from the city of Leningrad named Sergey
Zonov developed a Spectrum clone using only <b><i>41 ICs,</i></b> resulting
in a clone that was decently affordable, even on the humble average salary
of the USSR. This was an immediate success, and computers based on the
<i>"Leningrad
variant"</i> (later renamed Leningrad-1 to differentiate from the subsequent
Leningrad-2) were mass produced for almost a decade, becoming the most
popular ZX Spectrum variant in the former USSR.
<p>The USSR used its own naming scheme for ICs, but all the Soviet ICs
this computer was designed for have exact Western equivalents. As far as
I know, this is still the simplest ZX Spectrum clone to date that doesn't
use a programmable logic array in place of off-the-shelf logic.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Technical Description</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/lgd10_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgd10_th.jpg" ALT="Leningrad-1 system PCB" NOSAVE height=196 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>The
relative simplicity of the Leningrad-1's design comes at the cost of 100%
compatibility. The majority of software works just fine, but certain programming
tricks that rely on specific hardware timing may not look or sound like
they're supposed to.
<p>Having tested my Leningrad-1 with a decent amount of programs, I'd say
90-95% work with no problems whatsoever, while 97-98% are usable/playable
<i>(e.g.,
no game-breaking glitches).</i>
<p>The composite video output is monochrome, with color video available
from a SCART connector <i>(currently not working as of Revision 0)</i>
and a DIN-8 connector intended for connection to a custom external video
adapter <i>(e.g., VGA).</i>
<p>The commands that are used to play Yamaha AY audio on more advanced
Spectrum models appear to conflict with the border drawing circuitry. This
results in the border flickering when programs attempt to play AY music.
<p>I have made an effort to make this computer as easy to build as possible.
The value of almost every component <i>(excluding pin headers and two connectors)</i>
is printed on the silkscreen, so it's possible to assemble the whole thing
without having to check the bill of materials.
<p>To aid in ease of construction <i>(and cost reduction)</i>, the top
and bottom of the static-sensitive system PCB can be protected without
having to fabricate a case. The keyboard PCB is designed to mount on top
of the system PCB with standard nylon M3 screws and standoffs. Since most
PCB fabricators require that you order a minimum of 5 boards per design,
you can use one of the spare keyboard PCBs to cover the bottom side of
the system PCB.
<p>The keyboard and system PCBs are mounted together with 6 standoffs.
The keyboard has an extra 4 holes for standoffs that go through the keyboard
and sit on top of the system PCB. These are intended to add structural
stability - perfect for fast-paced action games!
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Making the Keyboard</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/lgrd4_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgrd4_th.jpg" ALT="Keyboard labels" NOSAVE height=213 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>The
ZX Spectrum was designed long before keyboard layouts had been standardized.
In addition, each key corresponds to several BASIC commands, which are
printed on the keys. Unfortunately, nobody makes Cherry MX compatible keycaps
with ZX Spectrum commands printed on them, so you have to make your own.
<p>I've found that the best way to do this is to order keycaps with removable
transparent covers (the same type often seen on point-of-sale terminals)
and print out labels to cut out and insert in the keycaps. Such keycaps
can be ordered cheaply from eBay or AliExpress under the search term "transparent
cover key caps".
<p>The end result is professional-looking <i>(depending on how good your
cutting skills are)</i>, durable keycaps that won't wear out over time.
<p>A pre-made image of key labels can be downloaded further down the page.
I designed it based on a combination of <a href="photos/lgrd6_fs.jpg">the
original Spectrum keyboard</a> and the labels from <a href="photos/lgrd5_fs.jpg">this
Soviet DIY computer kit</a> <i>(which was based on the Leningrad-1).</i>
<p>In total, the keyboard PCB has 40 single width keys in the original
ZX Spectrum layout, and one 6.25x width spacebar. To build the keyboard,
you'll need:
<ul>
<li>
5-pin MX-compatible keyswitches <b>(x41)</b> - <i>3-pin switches will work
as well, but they're trickier to mount evenly on the PCB.</i></li>

<li>
1x width transparent cover key caps <b>(x40)</b></li>

<li>
6.25x width spacebar <b>(x1)</b></li>

<li>
6.25x width MX-compatible spacebar stabilizer <b>(x1)</b> - <i>There appear
to be two versions of this, a panel mounted version and a PCB mounted version.
Only the PCB mounted version will fit on the PCB.</i></li>
</ul>
Technically the spacebar is optional, since the keyboard retains the corner
space key as seen on the original Spectrum.
<p>I'm working on a half-size keyboard that uses small tactile switches
as a cheaper alternative, but the mechanical keyboard offers a much nicer
typing experience.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Burning the ROM</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/eprm1_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/eprm1_th.jpg" ALT="27128 EPROM" NOSAVE height=198 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>If
you don't already have an (E)EPROM programmer, getting Sinclair BASIC onto
a ROM may be difficult.
<p>By default, the Leningrad-1 uses the original Sinclair ROM data burnt
onto a 27128 EPROM. It's possible to use some other models of (E)EPROM,
usually if the binary is written to the upper 16 KB of the chip.
<p>Some eBay sellers here in the UK sell pre-programmed EPROMs with newer,
open source versions of BASIC on them. These usually come with extra components
for modifying an original Spectrum to work with EPROMs, but these aren't
needed for Spectrum clones.
<p><a href="eprom.html">I have written an in-depth guide on how to get
started programming ROMs on this page,</a> with recommendations for what
kind of programmer to buy and a list of other chips that can be used in
place of the 27128.
<p>The (E)EPROM programming guide also has a collection of alternative
BASIC ROMs available for download.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Schematic</font></i></h4>
One thing that drew me towards recreating the Leningrad-1 in particular
is how the schematic is relatively easy to understand, despite its complexity.
Before ordering parts to build the Revision 0 PCB, I annotated the schematic
to the best of my ability to make sure I had everything in the right place.
This (mostly) annotated schematic should help explain how the Leningrad-1
works at the lowest level.
<p>The schematic can be downloaded in PDF form in the Downloads section
of this page.
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Getting Software</font></i></h4>
<a href="photos/lgrd7_fs.jpg"><img SRC="photos/lgrd7_th.jpg" ALT="Original repair guide" NOSAVE height=320 width=243 align=RIGHT></a>The
Leningrad-1's tape interface is compatible with original ZX Spectrum tapes,
with the exception that I haven't been able to get fast loading tapes to
work. This usually isn't a problem, since many programs were re-released
multiple times, and there's normally at least one version without fast
loading.
<p>Most Spectrum programs are distributed online as TAP or TZX files -
these are binary versions of the stream of data from the tape. These files
are designed for use primarily with emulators, and loading them onto real
hardware can be difficult.
<p>There's a variety of programs available that can convert these files
into more versatile standard audio formats. My favorite one is k7zx for
Windows, which you can download further down the page. It's a program from
2008, so it should run on Windows versions going back to XP <i>(maybe 2000)</i>,
and it runs well on my Windows 10 machine. It might also work on Windows
11. <i>(although if you're willingly using Windows 11, I suggest you consult
a psychiatrist)</i>
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Revision 0 PCB/Hardware Issues</font></i></h4>
<i>The first PCB is working for the most part, but there is room for improvement.
Below are my notes from assembling and testing it. I'm currently working
on a Revision 1 PCB which will implement fixes for all these issues.</i>
<p>Due to Soviet-era supply shortages, original Leningrad-1 boards were
assembled with a variety of different logic types <i>(7400, 74LS00, 74HCT00,
etc.)</i> with different switching speeds. Therefore, many fixes were proposed
for adjusting signal timing, mostly based on adding capacitors between
signal lines and GND. Since Revision 0 was intended partially as a testing
prototype, I added as many of these additional components to the PCB as
I could. Now I know what works best with 100% 74LS logic <i>(which is much
easier to find now than it was in the USSR!)</i> I'll remove the unnecessary
components in the next revision, simplifying the PCB and assembly process.
<p>The video signal isn't perfectly compliant to standard PAL/SECAM video
timings. Because of this, many TVs and monitors won't be able to display
a proper video signal and some displays simply refuse to display anything
at all. There are some known modifications for improving video signal compatibility
that I'll implement on the next revision.
<p>The tape loading circuit uses a Motorola MC1456 op-amp <i>(the closest
equivalent to the Soviet-made КР140УД6).</i> This part has been out
of production for decades, and usually sells for a staggering $10.00. There's
probably an equivalent op-amp that's still manufactured, but the whole
tape loading circuit can be simplified significantly; the Leningrad-1 tape
loading circuit uses 2 ICs and 11 discrete components, but the tape loading
circuit on the Leningrad-2 achieves the same functionality with only 1
IC and 4 discretes.
<p>I haven't been able to get the Kempston joystick interface to work.
In some games the character moves in the wrong directions, while in some
games the joystick does nothing at all. Some sources say that the Leningrad's
joystick interface is inherently flawed, and suggest ways of improving
it. However, the best solution may be to ditch the Kempston interface altogether
and implement a Sinclair interface instead. The Sinclair interface is mapped
directly to the keyboard, so there's not much to go wrong since the keyboard
works fine.
<p>The SCART connector is too far to the right side of the PCB. It turns
out some SCART connectors have brackets on the sides, which overlap with
one of the standoffs used to mount the keyboard onto the system board.
<p>The guide I found for connecting the Leningrad-1 to a SCART cable said
to leave pins 17 and 21 disconnected. This seems to have been a mistake,
as pin 17 is used as a ground for the sync signal <i>(pin 20)</i>.
<p>The audio output is too loud, which usually results in an extremely
coarse volume control on whatever it's plugged into. This could be fixed
by adding a resistor in series with the audio output.
